# Key-Master
A game inspired by Guitar Hero, designed on the LPC1768 MCU

This program was created for an embedded systems project. 
13 tactile buttons are used as inputs to the system. Each button represents one piano key.
A full octave beginning from middle C is configured in the project's current state.
